# Good Image Terminal

## A Wrong Tool for the Job

<!-- This project uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) to run Python directly in the browser using WebAssembly (WASM).  
Almost no JavaScript is required â€” the frontend is written entirely in Python and HTML/CSS. -->

This project is a web-based image editing tool that runs entirely in the browser through a terminal. It uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) to enable Python-based image processing without the need for a backend server. All while letting JavaScript sit back, relax, and just load the page.

The tool allows users to upload images and apply edits through various commands, all within a user-friendly interface.

## Packages

This project uses the following packages:

- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) - for image processing
- [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) - to run Python in the browser and for in-browser file management
