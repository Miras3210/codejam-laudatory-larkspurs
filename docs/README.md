Your presentation should cover the following:
- Describe what your project does? What features does the project have?
- How do you install and run the project? Are there multiple ways to install and run the project?
- Are there external dependencies a user should be aware of to run the project?
- What are the main ways someone can interact with the project? Are there commands to be aware of?
- Show it in action, how you use it, what the end result is, any really cool features
- The connection to the theme ('wrong tool for the job')
- Which approved library/framework was used and how it was used
- Roughly what each team member contributed
