# Summer Code Jam 12

This project is created as a part of the [Summer Code Jam 12](https://www.pythondiscord.com/events/code-jams/12/) event hosted by the Python Discord community.

> A Code Jam is a chance to create something with a team. In each jam, you are paired up with a group of other users just like yourself who will then be given a type of program to make and a theme to help guide it. You then have a little over a week's time to create the best project you can.
