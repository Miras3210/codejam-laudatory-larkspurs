# Features

## Terminal-like UI

The core interface mimics a terminal, with command input, output history, and colored feedback for success or error.

To implement the UI, we developed a custom lightweight GUI abstraction that wraps HTML elements. This abstraction allows us to create custom stateful GUI elements that can be easily extended and manipulated to create complex user interfaces.

## Command Suggestions

As you type, get realtime suggestions for available commands.

## Image Preview

The app provides a preview of the image you are currently editing. Also, you can drag and drop an image file onto the preview area to upload it for editing.

## Color/Position Information

The app provides information about the current cursor position and color of the pixel under the cursor.
